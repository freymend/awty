# Are We There Yet?

Remember when you were a kid on a long car ride, and you ket asking your parents "Are we there yet?" and annyoing the heck out of them? We want an application that does exactly that.

In this part, we will just pop `Toast` asking the question; in a future part, we will wire it up against SMS so that you can annoy the heck out of somebody else over text messages.

## Stories

As a user, when I "Start" the service, it should begin to "send messages" every N minutes, as given by the user in the EditText UI. These should be sent as SMS messages.

## Grading

continue to build in the awty repo

create a git branch called part-2 and do the new work on that branch

5 points, one for each story

### Extra credit

2 pts: send an audio message (doesn't need to be recorded on the device; it can be a static asset)

2 pts: send a video message (ditto--can be a static asset)
